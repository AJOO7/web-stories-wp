WEBVTT - Some title

00:00.000 --> 00:02.940
The most important thing to watch out for is burned-in text.

00:02.941 --> 00:05.686
Donâ€™t put your title of the story on the cover.

00:05.687 --> 00:07.687
Which might feel kind of intuitive.

00:07.684 --> 00:11.339
But if you look at all the stories in the discover carousel

00:11.341 --> 00:14.546
then you see that the text is on top of the cover.
