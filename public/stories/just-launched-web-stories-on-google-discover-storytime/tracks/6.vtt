WEBVTT - Some title

00:00.000 --> 00:02.700
What we're trying to do with Discover here is essentially

00:02.700 --> 00:06.100
build a marketplace of Web Story creators and

00:06.100 --> 00:08.800
users who are interested in your Web Stories. So

00:08.800 --> 00:11.700
the idea is you as creator, if you're say.. interested

00:11.700 --> 00:14.600
in hockey and you create a web story about hockey

00:14.600 --> 00:17.600
we're able to match that particular web story to a

00:17.600 --> 00:19.600
user that's also interested in hockey.
