WEBVTT - Some title

00:00.400 --> 00:03.100
Web stories are yours, hosted on your server, making

00:03.100 --> 00:05.900
you money and not the serving platform and can drive

00:05.900 --> 00:08.000
traffic to your site, YouTube account or whatever

00:08.000 --> 00:11.500
else you desire. They're also as short-lived or evergreen

00:11.500 --> 00:14.700
as you want and unlike with social platforms, nobody

00:14.700 --> 00:17.300
can dictate what content you create. It's the web

00:17.300 --> 00:18.400
so you make the rules.
