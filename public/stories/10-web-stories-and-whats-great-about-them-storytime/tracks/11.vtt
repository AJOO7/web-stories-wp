WEBVTT - Some title

00:00.000 --> 00:02.300
Just look at the Whimsical illustration with its wiggly

00:02.300 --> 00:05.200
lines. Right from the cover, this story understands me.

00:05.875 --> 00:08.770
It's instantly relatable, not just because of the excellent illustration

00:09.125 --> 00:12.670
but because the story is about me! It's not called how to deal with nighttime anxiety,

00:13.120 --> 00:17.165
it's tell me how I deal with nighttime anxiety. It starts with a reader question, then

00:17.575 --> 00:20.100
continues with bite-sized easy to grasp quotes from

00:20.100 --> 00:23.400
an authoritative subject expert and finally ends with a strong call

00:23.400 --> 00:26.250
to action on where to find more. 10/10, would read again.
