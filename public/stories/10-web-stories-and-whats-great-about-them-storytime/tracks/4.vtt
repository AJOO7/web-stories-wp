WEBVTT - Some title

00:00.000 --> 00:02.600
A typical recipe blog post doesn't convey the aspect

00:02.600 --> 00:04.800
of cooking well and most videos are too stressful

00:04.800 --> 00:07.300
as you can't easily skip or pause at the right moments.

00:07.300 --> 00:10.200
This story here solves both problems with an ultra-relatable

00:10.200 --> 00:13.100
chef that calmly walks us through the process of making

00:13.100 --> 00:15.200
Japanese Curry at the pace that works for you.
