WEBVTT - Some title

00:00.100 --> 00:02.700
The right imagery or videos are the make or break of

00:02.700 --> 00:05.000
a good web story. If you've been blogging on the web

00:05.000 --> 00:07.500
before, this is kind of counterintuitive with the

00:07.500 --> 00:09.500
a typical blog post or article you start with the

00:09.500 --> 00:12.000
copy and then find some image to visualize the point.

00:12.000 --> 00:15.400
With a web story, you start with the image and then write

00:15.400 --> 00:16.900
some copy to clarify your point.
