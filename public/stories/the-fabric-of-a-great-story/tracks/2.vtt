WEBVTT - Some title

00:00.000 --> 00:02.365
A web story should tell a full story and never just

00:02.390 --> 00:05.100
a trailer or teaser. Your story should be snackable

00:05.100 --> 00:08.200
but self-contained. It's okay to link to deep-dives like

00:08.200 --> 00:10.400
a long-form blog post explainer or in-depth youtube video,

00:10.400 --> 00:13.500
but don't make a single page story in an ill-conceived

00:13.500 --> 00:14.500
attempt to capture traffic.
